Wordsearcher is an online tool I built utilizing computer vision to identify word searches and uses a simple algorithm to solve them.

**Disclaimer:** doesn't work with non rectangular search areas, poorly lit images, or really bad quality images.

# How to use

### Step 1:

Upload an image by dragging it in, clicking "upload a file", or providing a link to the image. Then wait 30-40 seconds as the image is uploaded to the image server and is solved by the cloud.

### Step 2:

If everything went well, you should be taken to a page that looks like this where the AI has identified each and every letter.

Click "Show original image" to see the originally uploaded image and view the words that need to be searched for.

### Step 3:

Where it says "Add a word!", type a word to be searched and click the orange plus (+) button to add it to the list of words that need to be searched for. (You don't need to put perfect capitalization and/or spaces)
