Wordsearcher is an online tool I built utilizing computer vision to identify word searches and uses a simple algorithm to solve them.

**Disclaimer** doesn't work with non rectangular search areas or poorly lit images.

## How to use

### Step 1:

Upload an image by dragging it in, clicking "upload a file", or providing a link to the image. Then wait 30-40 seconds as the image is uploaded to the image server and is solved by the cloud.

Click "Show original image" to see the originally uploaded image so you can view the words that need to be searched for.
